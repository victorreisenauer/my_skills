# my_skills

## What is it?

In this "my_skills" Project I created and hosted a website from scratch, that allows users to list skills they want to learn, the respective online courses they plan on taking and establish timelines for doing so. 

In order to add, edit or delete courses and skills the user has to log into the web app, using their google or Facebook account. 

## How do I run it?

### Prerequisits:

You will have to have Vagrant installed and a virtual environment creator like VirtualBox. 

### Steps:

Fork my project, then download it from your GitHub account. The included VagrantFile will make sure your Vagrant is correctly configured when you use "vagrant up" to start up a new virtual machine.

After that you will be able to access the website via "localhost:5000" and click around. 

## Can I contribute?

Feel free to make as many changes as you'd like and share them with me! That way we can both learn from eachothers code!
